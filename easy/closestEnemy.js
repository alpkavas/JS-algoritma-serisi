/* 
    Have the function ClosestEnemy(arr) take the arpay of numbers
stored in arr and from the position in the arpay where a I is,
return the number Of spaces eİther left OF Fight you must
move to reach an enemy Which is represented by a 2.
For example:
if arp is [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2]
then your program should return 3 because the closest enemy (2)
is 3 spaces away from the 1.
The array contaİn any number of e 's and 2' s,
but only a single I. İt may not contain any 2' s at all as well.
where İn that case your program should return a e.
